What is a Bipartite Graph?
    A bipartite graph is a graph whose set of vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets U and V such that every edge connects a vertex from U to one in V.
    Properties:
    No two vertices within the same set are connected.
    Can contain cycles (but only even-length).
    Can be disconnected.
    What is a Tree?
    A tree is a special type of undirected graph that is:
    Connected

    Acyclic (no cycles)

    Has exactly n - 1 edges for n vertices

    Difference Between Bipartite Graph and Tree:

    Property	        Bipartite Graph	            Tree
    Cycles	            Allowed (even-length only)	Not allowed
    Connected	        Not necessarily	            Always connected
    Edges	            Varies	                    Exactly n - 1
    Vertex Partition	Two disjoint sets	        No such requirement

Is Every Bipartite Graph a Tree?
    ❌ No, not every bipartite graph is a tree.
    Example: A 4-node cycle (A-B-C-D-A) is bipartite but not a tree since it contains a cycle.
    ✅ However, every tree is a bipartite graph because:
    Trees are acyclic (no odd-length cycles),
    So they can always be 2-colored.

Which Data Structure is Used for Infix to Postfix Conversion and Vice Versa?
    The Stack data structure is primarily used for both:
    Infix to Postfix conversion
    Postfix to Infix conversion
        Practice some question for the deep understanding also.

ANIMATION:

✅ Which is used in industry-grade projects?
🔹 1. CSS Animations
✅ Widely used in production.

⚙️ Best for simple UI animations (hover effects, fades, loaders).

⚡ Very performant (hardware-accelerated with transform, opacity).

✅ Used in frameworks like Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.

🔹 2. JavaScript + GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)
🏆 Industry standard for complex, high-performance animations.

🎯 Used by big names: Google, Apple, Disney, etc.

🔧 Can animate anything: CSS, SVG, canvas, even scroll-based timelines.

🚀 Very powerful, especially for dynamic animations, timelines, and choreography.

🔹 3. Framer Motion (React)
⚛️ Industry standard for React projects.

Super intuitive, declarative syntax.

🔄 Supports complex gestures, transitions, and animations.

🔹 4. WebGL / Three.js
🎮 Used in 3D, immersive web apps, games, or interactive landing pages.

🧠 High learning curve, but used by top-tier creative studios.

Used in portfolios, product showcases, etc.
